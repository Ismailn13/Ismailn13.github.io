## Website link : 

### The repository contains a few different file types and everything is organised into separate folders
### The layouts folder contains the general layout of the website and is called upon when necessary
### The posts folder contains the markdown file which contains the main content of the blogpost
### The about folder contains the main content of the about page
### The css folder contains the main stylesheet which is used throughout the webpage
### The gitignore file ignores the file jekyll automatically generates (the site directory) and so we don't see the directory while we commit
### The config file is the main config of jekyll
### The index file in the main directory is the main webpage which can be used to go to the other pages on the website
### This repository demonstrates how jekyll auto generates an HTML page 
### Jekyll lets you write content from a simple markup language like markdown, and generates HTML files from it
